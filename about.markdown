### Greetings! 👋
Welcome to my internet home.

I want as few excuses as possible not to write, so as you explore the site, please expect to find:
- Loosely held and half-baked opinions and ideas.
- Mistakes - I may well share something I've only quickly researched.
- A mixed bag of topics but usually 'tech stuff' (SaaS, startups, edtech, fintech, product, serverless).

If you think something is great, terrible, prompts an idea, or you just want to say hi, I'd love to connect: {myfirstname}.hlauritzen@gmail.com ☕️

#### About me
Here are some things I've been up to over the past few years:

👨‍💻 **2019-now:** taught myself to code and started working as a software engineer (first in drone/security tech, then in fintech at [YouLend](https://youlend.com/)). I am excited about 'serverless and serviceful' architectures (see [this](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html), [this](https://www.infoq.com/articles/serverless-sea-change/#.W_lKKexTzFI.twitter), and [this](https://blenderphone.com/) for some background).

🚀 **2017-2019:** joined [Aula Education](https://aula.education) as first non-programmer hire, resulting in a firehose of learning about enterprise sales, marketing, building software products, and venture capital as I led efforts to sign our first 10 university partnerships and helped scale the company from 6 to 50 employees.

📈 **2016:** interned at [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/). Slept very little, learnt a lot: making excellent slides, using Excel, communicating with busy people, 80/20, etc.

🌍 **2015/16:** as President of [DSA](https://dsabroad.dk/), I worked with lots of great people, lobbied politicians to make it easier for Danes to study abroad, hosted a great careers conference in parliament, and got a taste for entrepreneurship e.g. by signing a big sponsorship deal and hiring our first employee.

📚 **2014-2017:** studied Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at the University of Oxford. Sat exams in subjects ranging from microeconomics and formal logic to theories of justice and Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. Got interested in [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) and (mostly) stopped eating meat.
