### Greetings! 👋 
I'm Mikkel, a Danish tech nerd based in London.

I use this site to share my ideas, learnings, and projects.

In the autumn of 2019, I taught myself to code and became a software engineer, so most of the posts on here will centre around 'programming stuff', meaning things like 'quality code', serverless, Javascript, React, databases, etc.

Other topics I am interested in, and hope to write about occasionally, include finance/investing, education technology, strategy, SaaS and startups, economics, philosophy, and 'effective altruism'.

I want as few excuses as possible not to write on this blog, so please expect loosely held opinions, half-baked views, and bad code. Equally, I take pride in changing my mind and adapting to feedback, so I'd love any input, disagreement, or tweaks on any of my posts / projects!

### Short bio 🔥
**Currently:** London-based Software Engineer.

**Previously:** Philosophy/Economics student at Oxford and the first non-tech hire at the edtech start-up [Aula Education](https://aula.education), where I focused on enterprise sales and implementation to sign our first university partnerships and helped scale the team from 6 to 50 employees.

### Long bio 🐌
(Probably coming soon-ish)
