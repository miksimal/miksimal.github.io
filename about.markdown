I'm Mikkel, a self-taught software engineer working at a fintech start-up in London.

Before becoming a developer, I was a salesperson/project manager, a business analyst, and an Oxford student (Philosophy and Economics).

I use this blog to share my learnings and projects - and to keep me accountable!
