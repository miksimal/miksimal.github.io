### Greetings! 👋 
I'm Mikkel, a Danish tech nerd based in London.

I use this site to share my ideas, learnings, and projects.

The two big reasons for doing this are to (a) learn faster through your disagreement, input, and feedback, and (b) to keep in touch with and get to know more people who share my interests. In short, don't be shy about reaching out. My email is {myfirstname}.h{mylastname}@gmail.com ☕️

### What to expect ❓ 

In the autumn of 2019, I taught myself to code and became a software engineer, so most of the posts on here will centre around 'programming stuff', meaning things like 'quality code', serverless, Javascript, React, databases, etc.

Other topics I am interested in, and hope to write about occasionally, include finance/investing, education technology, strategy, SaaS and startups, economics, and philosophy.

I want as few excuses as possible not to write on this blog, so please expect any opinions and ideas you find here to be 'half-baked' and subject to change (again, I'd love to hear your feedback!).

### Short bio 🔥
**Currently:** London-based Software Engineer.

**Previously:** Philosophy/Economics student at Oxford and the first non-tech hire at the edtech start-up [Aula Education](https://aula.education) where I focused on enterprise sales and implementation, signing our first university partnerships and helping scale the team from 6 to 50 employees.

### Long bio 🐌
(*Probably* coming soon)
