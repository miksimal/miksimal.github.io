### The challenge with 'drilling down'

A big challenge when doing self-paced learning projects to upskill in careers like software engineering (and many others) is ensuring that they actually lead to results.

In software engineering in particular, there are so many tempting topics to 'drill down' on. Surely, it'd be useful to spend a few weeks learning CSS Grid or *really* understanding data modelling in DynamoDB. Maybe you'll even do good *deliberate practice*, doing exercises and trying the new techniques.

The problem, as [Scott Young has found](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2019/11/15/drill-or-benchmark/), is that:
*'...these were rarely the projects that resulted in promotions, raises or transformations of a person's work.'* QUOTE

### Benchmark projects improve skills *and* produce a recognisable achievement

To learn as fast and impactfully as possible, I instead try to focus my learning objectives on 'benchmark projects'.

In short, a benchmark project is just the idea of ....

I choose an output or accomplishment as my goal. So instead of "Learn about AWS", I would go for "Achieve an AWS certification". Instead of "Learn about node modules", it could be "Create my own simple NPM module and write about it". This approach is great because it:


Instead of "Learn the fundamentals of serverless, networking, security, and databases on cloud providers like AWS", I decided to book and pay for an exam to become a certified [AWS Solutions Architect](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/).

Achieved AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification with just one month of study (AWS recommends at least "One year of hands-on experience designing available, cost-efficient, fault-tolerant, and scalable distributed systems on AWS" -- that is, I had to study hard for this exam!).

Getting to the level of understanding and knowledge where I could pass the AWS exam made me significantly more productive. I could now fluently discuss database types, trade-offs between hosting on EC2 instances vs. going fully serverless, autoscaling groups, the benefits/usecases of queuing systems like SQS. I also knew A LOT about moving from on-premise to cloud and managing a hybrid setup as well as lots of specifics about how Security Groups, Network Access Control Lists, private subnets, VPCs, internet gateways etc. come together -- none of which I really needed to know quite yet!


In summary, I find that benchmark projects:
+ motivate me as there is now a very clear finish line,
+ eliminate excuses to avoid pushing through the hard or uncomfortable aspects of the project, and
+ give me a concrete achievement or "thing" that I can point to after achieving each goal.


### Some project examples

Here are some of the benchmark projects I have completed so far:

+ Land my first developer job.
+ Become a certified AWS Solutions Architect.
+ Create [a blog](https://miksimal.com/) and write 5 posts.
+ Make my first open source contribution.

And some others that are in my backlog that I hope to prioritise soon:
+ [Develop an app](https://youtu.be/vcQ-5W9gj5c) / project that people I don't know use recurringly.
+ Publish an NPM package that could be useful to other people too.
+ Certified AWS Developer or one of the Professional certifications. 
+ one or two more here, see my notes...

### More ideas for developer benchmark projects?

Let me know, would be great to get inspiration.
