I try to keep all of my learning objectives focused on "benchmark projects".


Land my first developer job.


Achieved AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification with just one month of study (AWS recommends at least "One year of hands-on experience designing available, cost-efficient, fault-tolerant, and scalable distributed systems on AWS" -- that is, I had to study hard for this exam!).

Getting to the level of understanding and knowledge where I could pass the AWS exam made me significantly more productive. I could now fluently discuss database types, trade-offs between hosting on EC2 instances vs. going fully serverless, autoscaling groups, the benefits/usecases of queuing systems like SQS. I also knew A LOT about moving from on-premise to cloud and managing a hybrid setup as well as lots of specifics about how Security Groups, Network Access Control Lists, private subnets, VPCs, internet gateways etc. come together -- none of which I really needed to know quite yet!




I choose an output or accomplishment as my goal. So instead of "Learn about AWS", I would go for "Achieve an AWS certification". Instead of "Learn about node modules", it could be "Create my own simple NPM module and write about it". This approach is great because it:
+ motivates me as there is now a very clear finish line,
+ forces me to push through the hard and uncomfortable aspects of the learning to get to the end goal,
+ gives me a concrete achievement or "thing" that I can point to after achieving each goal.
