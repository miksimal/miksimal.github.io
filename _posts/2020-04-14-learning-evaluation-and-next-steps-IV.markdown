Since I started learning to code, I have done occassional learning "reviews" where I take stock of what I've learnt and decide
next steps in terms of what I should be learning (and how). [Scott Young has written about this](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2019/11/15/drill-or-benchmark/)

I try to keep all of them focused on "benchmark projects" that I can achieve. That is, rather than "Learn about AWS", I should go for "Achieve an AWS certification". 
Or, rather than "Learn about NPM" it could be "Create my own NPM module and write about it".

To keep me accountable to continuing a high pace of learning, I'll start posting them here. I'm at approximately the fourth big review, so here's a brief summary of the previous ones.

## Learning review, Rd. I (landed my first dev job)

Will do a more thorough write-up of what I did to get myself to a hireable level. The main resources I used were:

- Harvard CS50 course
- React course from udemy
- Eloquent Javascript book
- Coding challenges on Leetcode
- Listened to A LOT of podcasts, e.g. the first 250 episodes of Codepen Radio and most episodes of Syntax.

I got an opportunity to get a junior dev job very quickly for which the interview process involved three trial days of writing Android apps in Kotlin, 
so I also picked up some Kotlin specific resources such as "Kotlin Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide".

I got the job, so the next learning goal was to become a productive junior dev quickly.


## Learning review, Rd. II (became a productive junior dev)

At the new job, the role quickly changed from writing Android apps to setting up backend infrastructure on AWS to work with an iOS app.

Learning included: setting up a NoSQL database (DynamoDB) with a GraphQL API, push notifications using Lambdas, converting infrastructure to CloudFormation templates, Node.js (picked up Wes Bos' Node course), and Swift/iOS (raywenderlich.com courses).

Even wrote my first bash script to automate some folder creation/deletion and config edits needed every time we did a codegen related to using the GraphQL API on the iOS frontend.

Overall I learned LOTS, covered a lot of fundamentals, and went from feeling like an imposter to feeling like I could add value as a dev.

The only downside was that we were a team of relatively junior people (most of whom had masters degrees in computer science, but still), so knowledge of best practices and of industry standards was somewhat limited. 
I therefore decided that the next step in my learning would be to get involved in the dev community and to expand the breadth of my knowledge of AWS services and best practices by taking the AWS Solutions Architect certification.

## Learning review, Rd. III (community + AWS certified)

Went to my first tech meet-up. Achieved AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification with just one month of study (AWS recommends at least "One year of hands-on experience designing available, cost-efficient, fault-tolerant, and scalable
distributed systems on AWS" -- that is, I had to study hard for this exam!).

Getting to the level of understanding and knowledge where I could pass the AWS exam enabled me to be significantly more productive. I could now fluently discuss database types, trade-offs between hosting on EC2 instances vs. going fully serverless, the benefits/usecases of queuing systems like SQS, and A LOT I probably did not need to know about moving from on-premise to cloud or managing a hybrid setup!

Not long after, I got talking to a very experienced CTO at an exciting fintech start-up that my friend worked at...
