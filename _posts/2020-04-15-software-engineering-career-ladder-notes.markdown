I recently did a bit of research on role expectations for mid-level / "non-junior" engineers to help guide my learning.

### Approach

My approach was to look at various different companies public career ladders and see what the common traits/achievements for "non-junior" / mid-level engineers were. My main source for these career ladders was [swyx' excellent collection of public career ladders](https://www.swyx.io/writing/career-ladders/).

I found the following three career ladders to be the clearest and most applicable:
+ [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/handbook/appendix-05-titles-for-programmers)
+ [RentTheRunway](https://dresscode.renttherunway.com/blog/ladder)
+ [Fog Creek](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2009/02/13/fog-creek-professional-ladder/)


### The five traits and skills that make someone a "non-junior" engineer

These five categories seemed the most important in the majority of the career ladders.

**Independence**: learns quickly and independently; able to prioritise tasks; doesn't get caught up in unimportant details; work only occassionally needs material feedback.

**Scope**: able to own clearly defined individual small-medium sized features from technical design through to completion.

**Engineering**: understands basic software engineering principles; familiar with industry best practices; understands the system architecture.

**Code**: able to write correct and clean code; good sense of "code smells"; mastery of basic language featuers and most advanced structures.

**Communication**: able to work well as part of a team; able to prioritise tasks; asks for and gracefully accepts feedback.
